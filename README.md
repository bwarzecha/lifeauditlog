Life Audit Log

## The Idea
Wouldn't it be awesome to be able to move back in time and check exactly what happened? People write their journal with everything they would like to track, but this requires discipline and it's constrained by how much you can log manully. Nowadays we have sensors everywhere around us, phones in our pockets, laptops, smart watches, fitness trackers, fridges with internet :-D.. What if we could store our digital life in a form of event log. Something which could be queried, something which would allow us to define metrics. Maybe we are completly blind to patterns in our lifes like: 'reading news makes me less likely to do coding in the folling day' (joke :-)) 

## Senors
- Phone (Location, Connected WIFI, open apps, messages, calls)
- Laptop (Browser History, Open Apps, keystrokes (speed?), wifi connected? )
- Online Services History (YouTube, Bank Statement, WhatsApp history)
- Home sensors  (Temp, Humidity, Light, presence in room, noise level?)
- Photos? (Photos with location?)
